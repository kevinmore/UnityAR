## AR Cube Project

This is a Unity based project, for the technical test interview with Holome.

## Overview

A cube would appear above the image target when the target is found. And will smoothly translate into the camera space when the target is lost.

The texture is downloaded and cached in the local file system for the first time, and it will be set from cache later on.

All the scripts I have written can be found in folder "_Scripts".

## Build

Please find the APK and image target file under folder "Release".

## SDK used

* Google Firebase Storage
* Vuforia
* iTween
